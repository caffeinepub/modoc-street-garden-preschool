# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the Oregon flower decorative images from the Home page decorative background layer.

**Planned changes:**
- Delete the four non-interactive, aria-hidden Oregon flower `<img>` elements under the "New Oregon flower decorations" comment in the Home page decorative background layer.
- Ensure the Home page still renders without console errors and that all other layout/content remains unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** The Home page looks the same as before except the Oregon flower decorative images no longer appear in the background.
